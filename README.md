### Traefik

So, in my last post (https://github.com/Pungyeon/docker-example) I wrote about docker and containerisation, using a NodeJS web app as an example of how easy it is to containerise an application. In this post, I will introduce the load-balancing and reverse-proxy `traefik`. Traefik is a lightweight service, written in Google's programming language golang, built specifically for use in microservice and container architecture.

The need for a service like traefik comes from the nature of microservice and container architectures, being extremely dynamic. This is not something that we are typically used to and neither are our reverse-proxies (like nginx). We are used to everything being somewhat static, so having to change an ip-address or hostname in our nginx configuration every once in a while, doesn't really concern us much. However, containers completely threw out the static nature of our web services out of the window. As an example, Google spin up around 2 billion containers every week. Now, they aren't all web servers, but even if 1% of them are, you don't want anyone to be manually configuring that. Therefore, we need an automated way of handling our reverse-proxy and load-balancing needs. Enter traefik.

Traefik uses event calls directly from the container platform (in our case Docker), to make changes in the running configuration. This makes our life much easier, when scaling services, adding new versions of our service etc. So, let's find out how to set this up, so we can scale some containers!

### Prerequisites

I will be using an Ubuntu 16.04 for this tutorial, but feel free to use your operating system of choice! Docker is available for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux, so I suggets using whatever your are already comfortable with. To install docker, follow the instruction from the official docker site: 

Ubuntu
https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository

Mac OSX
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#install-and-run-docker-for-mac

Windows
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

We will also need Nodejs for this tutorial, which can be installed from: https://nodejs.org/en/

Now, use your favourite text-editor for this, there is no requirements there. However, I prefer and recommend using Visual Code, which you can get for free here: https://code.visualstudio.com/

All the code written in this tutorial can be found at https://github.com/Pungyeon/docker-compose-example

Alright, enough prerequisites and installing! Let's get on with it!

### Initialising our project

So to make things easy, so that we don't have to start from scratch, let's clone the code from my last write-up:

> git clone https://github.com/Pungyeon/docker-example

Now, we can go into our new directory `docker-example` and run `npm install`, which will download all the dependencies and packages that we need to run our NodeJS server.

Great, now we are all setup to start writing some code. If you prefer not writing any code or build files yourself, you can simply clone the `https://github.com/Pungyeon/docker-compose-example` repository instead.

### NodeJS Server

So, first things first, we will edit our already existing NodeJS server code to add some database functionality.

#### server.js
```javascript
var express = require('express');
var fs = require('fs');
var os = require('os');

var app = express();

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    var hostInfo = {
        hostname: os.hostname(),
        network: os.networkInterfaces()['eth0'][0].address
    }
    res.json(hostInfo);
});

app.listen(3000);

console.log("Server listening on port 3000");
```
So, all we have changed in our server file is that we have imported the 'os' variable, which we will use to retrieve operating system information. We have also changed the '/' path to return the host information instead of our index.html file. The host information will include the hostname and ip-address of the docker container.

### Putting it together with Docker Compose

The reason why we want to have our server responding with host information, is because of what we will do next. We will write a docker-compose file, which essentially is a build file, which can specify multiple docker images. As an example, you can spin up a web server, database and a backend server with the same docker-compose file. However, for our example we will suffice with defining a load-balancer/reverse-proxy, traefik, and our web server.

```yaml
version: "2"
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik
    command: --web --docker --docker.domain=docker.localhost --logLevel=DEBUG
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - /dev/null:/traefik.toml
  web:
    build: .
    labels:
      - "traefik.backend=webserver"
      - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:web.pungy.local"
    
```

For traefik, we will define the image traefik, which will be pulled from the traefik docker repository. The command will specify the runtime commands for traefik, the most important one here being the `--docker.domain` which will determine the default hostnames for our containers. So in this case, the deafult hostname will be the container name prepended to the domain name specified in this command (In our case, our `traefik` server, will become something similar to `traefik.dockerexample.docker.localhost`). 

Under ports we will specify which ports to expose and what they are mapped to on the host. We will expose port 80 for communicating with our web server through HTTP and port 8080 for communicating with the traefik dashboard. Under volumes, we can define some persistent volumes for the container (Essentially, these are folders on the host running the docker containers that ensure if we stop and start the docker container, we won't lose previous data).

Lastly, we will define our `web` service. For the build, we will use the Dockerfile we defined in my last post, by referring to the current path with `.`. We will also add some labels to this service: `traefik-backend` determines how the service is defined in traefik (on the backend) and `traefik.frontend.rule` essentially overrides our default hostname, with a specific hostname. In this case, I have named our web service `web.pungy.local`.

### Running our setup

Great, all we need to do now is build our images.

> docker-compose build

This will download the `traefik` image to our host and build our web server, using the Dockerfile build file. Afterwards, we can run our docker-compose build with:

> docker-compose run -d 

The `-d` flag ensuring that we will run the services in the background. Now, we can visit our traefik dashboard at http://localhost:8080 and have a look at our running containers. On the bottom of the dashboard, you will be able to see a routing rule for our web server, with a host name similar to `Host:web.pungy.local`. This is the hostname that our webserver has received from our traefik reverse-proxy. To ensure that everything is working, let's send off a request!

> curl -H Host:web.pungy.local http://localhost

> Note: that the -H tag adds headers. In this case we have added a Host header, with the hostname defined in traefik. This can be substituted with a DNS or /etc/hosts entry.

If all goes well, we will receive a response including the hostname and ip-address of our web server container. So, you might be thinking: "I'm pretty sure we were able to do this without the docker-compose file and the traefik reverse-proxy. Why did we go through all that?". Well, let's imagine that our web service has become extremely popular and it's receiving more requests than single-core nodejs can handle. No problem!

> docker-compose scale web=3

The command above will ensure that we have three concurrent web services running. In other words, this will add 2 running web servers to our running config. You can check out your traefik dashboard and confirm that this is the case. Traefik will now load-balance our requests to these three servers, without us having to change any configs, traefik takes care of updating it's routes by retrieving information about changes from docker and responding to this information by changing the route configuraitons accordingly. We can confirm that our load-balancing is working by sending a few of our requests again.

> curl -H Host:web.pungy.local http://localhost

If all is well, we will see differing requests, depending on which hosts are responding to our requests.

Wow, pretty neat, huh? We are pratically docker gods by now...... Well, not really, there is still so much to learn. Running containers on a single machine is great, but it's not quite the end goal. To get into container clustering, we will have to take a look at Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, CoreOS, Rancher or one of the other many solutions for container orchestration. 

Maybe that will be the topic of the next post, either way, I hope that this post gave a little insight into using traefik as a load-balancer/reverse-proxy and how powerful of a tool it is. I also hope it gave a little additional insight into the advantages of containerised services. Either way, feedback is very welcome!

...and one last thing, to shutdown our docker-compose services, run the following command:

> docker-compose down
